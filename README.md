The documentation and code here is a fork from [loganw/Sketch_Auto-rename-artboards](https://github.com/loganw/Sketch_Auto-rename-artboards).

This fork is a small change that renames the artboards different 

# Auto rename artboards
Renames artboards using the artboard position and the name you have given to the layer

In Logan’s version the artboards are renamed: [Page name] – [A,B,C... (row) ] [00, 01, 02... (column)].
In this fork, artboards are renamed: [A,B,C... (row) ] [00, 01, 02... (column)] _ [Artboard name]

When you reposition the artboard and rerun the script. Only the numbering changes. Nothing after ' _ '. So long as you don’t use another underscore in your layer name.
